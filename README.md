# Automated API DDT (Data-Driven Test) Framework
## Overview

API Data-driven testing (DDT) describes a way of testing where test input data and assertions keys and expected values are all driven from a table. Typically the table is a spreadsheet with every row represent a test step or an API call.

The advantage of DDT is the ease to add additional rows to the spreadsheet when new test scenarios are added to the product (API) under test. Also, in DDT, the test environment settings and control are not hard-coded. 

This API DDT Framework is developed using SmartBear ReadyAPI product. To use the framework you will have to get a license or you can download the trial version of SmartBear ReadyAPI.

If you adopt this framework for your API testing, you are not only going to save a lot of time and money, you would also easily add security and performance testing to your API product testing without any extra effort as both tests are embedded in this DDT framework.

## 1. Read the article at my blog
Before you go any further, it is better to go through the article I published in my blog titled [DX: How to boost the performance of your APIs - Part I](https://www.earth2.digital/blog/How-to-boost-the-performance-of-your-APIs-1-adam-ali.html)
## 2. Check out to create git repository on your machine?
1. Create new directory
```
$ mkdir api-ddt-framework
$ cd api-ddt-framework
```
2. Initialize git repository in the newly created directory
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/{username}/Downloads/api-ddt-framework/.git/
$
```
3. Get a copy of this repo

```
$ git clone git@github.com-{gihubUsername}:earth2digital/automated-api-ddt-framework.git
Cloning into 'automated-api-ddt-framework'...
Enter passphrase for key '/Users/{Username}/.ssh/id_rsa':
